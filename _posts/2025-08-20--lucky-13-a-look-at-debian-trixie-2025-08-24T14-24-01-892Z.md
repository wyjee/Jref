<p>After more than two years of development, the Debian Project has <a
href="https://www.debian.org/News/2025/20250809">released</a> its new stable version, Debian&#160;13 ("trixie"). The release comes with the usual bounty of
upgraded packages and more than 14,000 new packages; it also debuts <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1017315/">Advanced Package Tool
(APT)&#160;3.0</a> as the default package manager and makes 64-bit
<span class="nobreak">RISC-V</span> a supported architecture. There are few surprises with trixie,
which is exactly what many Linux users are hoping for&mdash;a free
operating system that just works as expected.</p>
