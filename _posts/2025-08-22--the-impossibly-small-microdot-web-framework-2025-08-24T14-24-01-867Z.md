The <a
href="https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/microdot?tab=readme-ov-file#microdot">Microdot</a>
web framework is quite small, as its name would imply; it supports both
standard CPython and <a href="https://micropython.org/">MicroPython</a>,
so it can be used on systems ranging from internet-of-things (IoT) devices
all the way up to large, cloudy servers.  It was developed by Miguel
Grinberg, who gave a presentation about it at <a
href="https://ep2025.europython.eu/">EuroPython&#160;2025</a>.  His name
may sound familiar from his well-known <a
href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world">Flask
Mega-Tutorial</a>, which has introduced many to the <a
href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/">Flask</a> lightweight Python-based
web framework.  It should come as no surprise, then, that Microdot is
inspired by its rather larger cousin, so Flask enthusiasts will find much
to like in Microdotâ€”and will come up to speed quickly should their needs turn
toward smaller systems.
