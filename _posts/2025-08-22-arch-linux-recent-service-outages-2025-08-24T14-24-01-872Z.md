href="https://lists.archlinux.org/archives/list/arch-general@lists.archlinux.org/thread/EU4NXRX6DDJAACOWIRZNU4S5KVXEUI72/">service
outages</a> that have affected its infrastructure:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>The Arch Linux Project is currently experiencing an ongoing denial
of service attack that primarily impacts our main webpage, the Arch
User Repository (AUR), and the Forums.</p>

<p>We are aware of the problems that this creates for our end users
and will continue to actively work with our hosting provider to
mitigate the attack. We are also evaluating DDoS protection providers
while carefully considering factors including cost, security, and
ethical standards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The post contains information on workarounds to use during the
service disruption, and notes that Arch is not sharing technical
details about the attack or mitigation while the attack is still
ongoing.</p>
